/**
 * Decide whether a store LISTING actually changed since it was last published.
 *
 * fastlane never asks: `supply` and `deliver` upload whatever sits in the fastlane trees on every
 * run, with no comparison against the live listing (the one exception is Play's image sync, which
 * hashes images and uploads only the differences). On iOS our lane overwrites screenshots, so an
 * unconditional publish deletes and re-uploads every screenshot in every locale even when nothing
 * moved — slow, and one more thing that can fail halfway through a release.
 *
 * So the gate lives here instead: fingerprint exactly what a publish would upload, compare it with
 * the fingerprint recorded by the last successful publish, and let the workflow skip the push when
 * they match. Listing content is generated and committed (store-metadata.mjs for the texts,
 * store-screenshots.mjs for the images), so the fingerprint is a property of the commit — no need
 * to interrogate the stores.
 *
 * The record lives in the store-asset repo at fastlane/publish-state.json, written only AFTER a
 * publish succeeds. Keeping it in git (rather than CI cache) makes it durable and reviewable: the
 * diff shows when each store last went out. An unknown store — no state file, or a first-ever
 * publish — always counts as changed, so the gate can never silently skip the first upload.
 *
 * Scope follows what the listing lanes actually send. Android changelogs are excluded because the
 * listing lane skips them (they belong to the release, keyed by version code); iOS release notes
 * are included because deliver does push them.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node e2e/store-publish-state.mjs --root ../Vpnhood.App.Client            report (+ GITHUB_OUTPUT)
 *   node e2e/store-publish-state.mjs --root ../Vpnhood.App.Client --update ios
 *                                                                           record ios as published
