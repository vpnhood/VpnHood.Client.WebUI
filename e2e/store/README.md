# Store pipeline — maintainer's map

This document is the entry point for maintaining the store screenshot/listing pipeline. It is
written for a maintainer with **zero context** — human or AI — because the code was built and is
maintained without line-by-line review. Read this before changing anything; update it when the
shape of the system changes. Detailed *why* lives as comments at the top of each file named below —
this file tells you which file owns what, which invariants must hold, and how to verify a change
without trusting anyone's memory.

## The system in one paragraph

The **WebUI repo** (this repo) owns every tool. The **store-asset repos**
(`vpnhood/Vpnhood.App.Client`, `vpnhood/Vpnhood.App.Connect`) own the *content*: translatable
source texts, generated screenshots, compiled fastlane trees — no app source. The **main repo**
(`vpnhood/VpnHood`) owns every *publish action*: binaries, GitHub releases, and the shared listing
workflow that the store repos call. Nothing ever writes across repo boundaries, which is what keeps
the whole pipeline free of PATs: a reusable workflow runs in its **caller's** context, so when a
store repo calls main's workflow, checkouts and commits land on the store repo with its own token.

## Data flow

```
store-i18n/en-US/store.json     hand-written EN source texts   (store repo)
store-i18n/en-US/subscriptions.json   hand-written EN subscription texts (store repo)
        │ vhtranslator (Gemini) → 12 sibling locales (both files, same run)
        ▼
store-metadata.mjs              compiles texts → fastlane/metadata/{android,ios}/<locale>/*.txt
store-screenshots.mjs           renders SPA against fixture.json → fastlane screenshots/images
store-subscriptions.mjs         pushes subscription texts DIRECT to App Store Connect (no fastlane
                                path exists for in-app-purchase localizations), run by hand
        │  both run in update-screenshots.yml (store repo), which commits the results
        │  CLIENT uses the built-in e2e/store/*; CONNECT passes its own store/project.mjs
        │  + store/fixture.json through the action's `project` input
        ▼
publish_listing.yml (stub, store repo) → publish_listing.yml (main, reusable)
        ├─ gate: store-publish-state.mjs   fingerprint vs fastlane/publish-state.json
        ├─ _publish_listing_appstore.yml   deliver (text) + store-asc-screenshots.mjs (images)
        ├─ _publish_listing_play.yml       fastlane supply (text + checksum-synced images)
        └─ record: commits updated fingerprints back to the store repo
```

Binaries are a separate, parallel path: `publish_client.yml` / `connect_publish.yml` →
`publish_app.yml` → build modules → TestFlight / Play / GitHub release. A release uploads the
binary and its changelog and **never** the listing (see the `playstore` lane comments).

**Release notes** ("What's New") have their own source — the monorepo's hand-maintained
CHANGELOG.md — and their own refresh workflow, but ride the same translation and shipping rails:

```
vpnhood/VpnHood CHANGELOG.md    first H1 section ("# Latest"), hand-written EN, line tags:
        │                       #client/#connect (product) · #android #ios #windows #linux
        │                       (platforms, inclusive; none = all) · #store (Play's short note)
        ▼ store-release-notes.mjs extract     runs in update-release-notes.yml (store repo)
store-i18n/en-US/release-notes.json   one key per line (content-hashed: an edited line is
store-i18n/release-notes.map.json     retranslated, the rest reused) + order/routing map
        │ vhtranslator (same run) → sibling locales, changed lines only
        ▼ store-release-notes.mjs compile
fastlane/metadata/ios/<locale>/release_notes.txt          ships with the LISTING publish
fastlane/metadata/android/<locale>/changelogs/default.txt ships with the RELEASE (any versionCode)
```

## The tools (all in `e2e/`)

| file | contract |
|---|---|
| `store/project.mjs` | All per-app config: locales (+ per-store code overrides), platforms, devices, shots, install dirs. Data only — change *what* is generated here, never in the engine. This built-in copy is the **CLIENT**; CONNECT owns its own at `Vpnhood.App.Connect/store/project.mjs`, passed via `--project` (the action's `project` input). A store repo's config must import nothing outside Node built-ins — the workflow's `plan` job imports it in a checkout with no `node_modules` — and resolves engine assets through `process.cwd()`, which the action sets to the engine root. |
| `store/fixture.json` | The mocked `/api/app` state screenshots render against. Never real keys/IPs/IDs. Connect's sits beside its project file. Anything derived from app logic (per-location `options`, category tags) must be computed with the rules in `ClientServerLocationInfo.cs`, never hand-written, or the listing can claim a tier the app would not grant. |
| `store-screenshots.mjs` | Renders, frames, and installs screenshots. Every written PNG goes through `recompressPng` — Chromium's canvas encoder leaves ~half the file on the table, so this recompresses **pixel-for-pixel** (verified against an independent decoder; an image library was rejected for altering subpixels while claiming lossless). ~2x smaller, which is what keeps the store-asset repos clonable for the F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid catalogues. Intended to be deterministic (same inputs → same bytes) — but see "Known non-determinism" below; it does not hold for text-heavy pages. |
| `store-metadata.mjs` | Compiles `store-i18n` texts into fastlane trees. Fails loud on limits/missing keys/platform names in iOS copy (Guideline 2.3.10). `--check` validates without writing. |
| `store-release-notes.mjs` | Release notes from the monorepo CHANGELOG: `extract` (first H1 section → per-line store-i18n source + routing map) and `compile` (translations → iOS `release_notes.txt`, cap 4000, 2.3.10-linted; Play `changelogs/default.txt` from the `#store` lines, cap 500). Config is the project file's `RELEASE_NOTES` export — `product` picks the `#client`/`#connect` lines, `ios: false` deletes the iOS files (Apple rejects a FIRST App Store version that carries "What's New"). Missing map = not adopted, warn + skip; anything else wrong = red. |
| `store-publish-state.mjs` | Fingerprints what a publish would send; compares with `fastlane/publish-state.json` in the store repo. Text hashed as LF (CRLF checkouts must fingerprint identically to CI). Record only after a **verified** publish. |
| `store-asc-screenshots.mjs` | Checksum-sync of App Store screenshots (the Play `sync_image_upload` equivalent). Replaces deliver's delete-all mode. Phased against Apple's ghost-delete 500s — the file header documents the observed evidence. `--check` reports drift. |
| `store-icon.mjs` | Strips alpha from iOS appiconsets (ITMS-90717). Refuses genuinely translucent pixels. |
| `store-subscriptions.mjs` | Pushes subscription texts (group name, per-product name + description) from `store-i18n/*/subscriptions.json` straight to App Store Connect. Not part of the listing publish: fastlane has no in-app-purchase localization path, so `deliver` cannot carry these and the API is the only route. Keys are product ids, so a fork edits the JSON and no code — same choice `asc-iap.mjs` makes with `--products`. Enforces Apple's limits (name 30, description 45) before sending, and prints each product's state afterwards because editing a `READY_TO_SUBMIT` product can move it. Idempotent; `--check` reports drift. Play needs no equivalent — Google takes subscription texts from the Play Console only. |

## Invariants — do not break these

1. **Generated files are never hand-edited**: fastlane trees come from the compiler/engine;
   `store-i18n/<non-en>/` comes from vhtranslator; only `store-i18n/en-US/store.json` and
   `store-i18n/en-US/subscriptions.json` are written by hand. `store-i18n/en-US/release-notes.json` and `release-notes.map.json` are generated too
   (from the monorepo CHANGELOG — the hand-written surface is the CHANGELOG's `# Latest` section).
   Hand-edits are silently overwritten by the next generation run.
2. **No repo writes to another repo.** If a change seems to need that, the design is wrong or a
   deliberate credential decision is being made (see main's `docs/cicd/deployment.md`).
3. **`publish-state.json` records only verified publishes.** A cancelled or failed store leg must
   not be recorded — otherwise the gate skips a store that never got the content. The workflow's
   `record` job enforces this via each module's `published` output.
4. **Fail loud.** Every tool throws on missing files, unknown locales, limit overflows. Never add
   a silent fallback; VpnHood is fail-closed by policy.
5. **Missing credential = warn + skip + green; present-but-failing = red.** The fork-friendliness
   convention, documented per-secret in main's `docs/cicd/deployment.md`.
6. **iOS copy never names other platforms** (Android/Google Play/Windows/Linux) — App Store
   Guideline 2.3.10. The compiler lints texts; screenshots must respect it too (the Servers page
   promo was removed on iOS for this — don't reintroduce it).

## Known non-determinism (open)

`store-screenshots.mjs` is *meant* to be byte-deterministic, and the gate assumes it: a shot that
re-renders differently is re-uploaded to every store on every run, which is exactly what the
fingerprint gate exists to prevent — and repeated App Store screenshot replacement is the fragile
path (see the ghost-delete note below).

**It does not hold for text-heavy pages.** Reproduced on Connect's Servers shot (a 22-row location
list): six identical local runs produced **two** distinct outputs. The diff is ~4,200 sparse pixels
confined to the text-glyph band, and the two states *cluster* across consecutive runs rather than
alternating randomly — which points at the rasterization path, not at app or fixture behaviour.

Ruled out: a webfont race. Awaiting `document.fonts.ready` before capture does **not** fix it
(tested, then reverted — do not re-add it as a fix without new evidence).

Still untested: forcing deterministic text rasterization at launch
(`--disable-lcd-text`, `--font-render-hinting=none`, `--force-color-profile=srgb`). That would
re-render every shot in both apps, so it needs its own verified change, not a drive-by.

The CLIENT does not show this today only because its Servers shot is the short add-a-key screen.
Any new long, text-dense shot will inherit the problem.

## Apple lore (hard-won, with evidence)

- **Screenshot replace = delete + create of the same fileName.** Apple's deletes are eventually
  consistent; a create that reuses a just-deleted name can 500 **and keeps 500ing while retried**
  (observed >15 min), yet succeeds when tried once later. Hence the phased sync. Never reintroduce
  a delete-everything re-upload (deliver's `overwrite_screenshots`) into CI.
- **A cancelled screenshot push scrambles display order** (uploads land in completion order; the
  ordering PATCH runs last). `store-asc-screenshots.mjs` restores order even on failed runs.
- **First-version quirks**: v1 has no "What's New" (`release_notes.txt` must not exist for it —
  `RELEASE_NOTES.ios: false` in the project config keeps it deleted); deliver's first-version text
  push raises a benign "No data" (rescued in each store repo's Fastfile `upload_metadata` lane —
  removable once 1.0 is live).
- **"What's New" is never carried over to a new version** — the field starts empty and is required
  per localization once the app has a prior release. The fingerprint gate compares only repo
  content, so before honoring a skip it probes the live listing
  (`store-asc-screenshots.mjs --whatsnew-check`, exit 4 = empty fields to fill) and pushes the
  otherwise-unchanged text to fill them. No manual `force=true` needed for this case.
- **The listing locks while a version is in review or live with none open.** That is a normal
  state between releases: the appstore module probes it (`--editable-check`, exit 3 = locked) and
  warns + skips with `published=false`, so the gate re-publishes once a version opens. A locale on
  the listing without local screenshots is likewise a warn-and-skip (staged rollout — text ships
  before screenshots; the storefront falls back to the primary locale's images), while local
  screenshots for a locale the listing lacks stay a hard error.
- **ASC API**: JWT ES256, `exp` ≤ 20 min (Apple rejects at the cap; use 15). Subtitle and privacy
  URL live on `appInfoLocalizations`; description/keywords/promo/URLs on
  `appStoreVersionLocalizations`. `sourceFileChecksum` is the MD5 of the uploaded file — the basis
  of the sync diff.
- **Review submissions are a basket (`reviewSubmissions`) whose contents are near-opaque.** Items
  list with **empty relationships**, and `GET /v1/reviewSubmissionItems/<id>` is **403**, so the only
  way to know what is in a basket is to base64-decode the item id: it is
  `<submissionId>|<typeCode>|<targetId>`. Type codes seen so far — `6` appStoreVersion, `18`
  subscriptionVersion, `19` subscriptionGroupVersion.
- **To add a subscription to a submission, add its VERSION, not the product.** `reviewSubmissionItems`
  has no `subscription` relationship — that returns `409 ENTITY_ERROR.RELATIONSHIP.UNKNOWN`, which
  reads like a key/role problem and is not, and cost two rounds of chasing permissions. The
  relationship is `subscriptionVersion`, taking an id from `/v1/subscriptions/<id>/versions`
  (each product has one pending version, `PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION`):

  ```jsonc
  { "data": { "type": "reviewSubmissionItems", "relationships": {
      "reviewSubmission":    { "data": { "type": "reviewSubmissions",    "id": "<submission id>" } },
      "subscriptionVersion": { "data": { "type": "subscriptionVersions", "id": "<version id>" } } } } }
  ```
- **`store-subscriptions.mjs` has a submission side effect.** Writing group-level text creates a
  pending *subscription group version* that joins the open review submission **by itself**; the
  products do not follow. Submitting in that state fails with *"New subscription groups must be
  submitted with an auto-renewable subscription from within that group"* — a new group with nothing
  buyable in it. After any group-localization change on an unreleased group, add both product
  versions to the basket before submitting.
- **App icons must have no alpha channel** (ITMS-90717) — rejected on channel presence, not
  transparency. Applies to every size in the appiconset, app and extension both.

## How to verify (never trust, always run)

```bash
# texts compile clean and within store limits
node e2e/store-metadata.mjs --check --root ../Vpnhood.App.Client

# what would a publish send vs. what was last published?
node e2e/store-publish-state.mjs --root ../Vpnhood.App.Client

# is the LIVE App Store listing exactly the repo content? (counts, checksums, order)
node e2e/store-asc-screenshots.mjs --bundle-id com.vpnhood.client.ios \
  --root ../Vpnhood.App.Client --keys-dir ../.user --check

# full pipeline, CI: dispatch and watch
gh workflow run publish_listing.yml -R vpnhood/Vpnhood.App.Client
gh workflow run update-screenshots.yml -R vpnhood/Vpnhood.App.Client -f webui-ref=develop

# CONNECT: same workflows, but the engine needs Connect's own config
node e2e/store-screenshots.mjs --project ../Vpnhood.App.Connect/store/project.mjs \
  --platform ios --locale en-US --only 1
gh workflow run update-screenshots.yml -R vpnhood/Vpnhood.App.Connect -f webui-ref=develop
```

The Gemini key is the org secret `GOOGLE_GEMINI_TRNSLATE_APP_API_KEY` (one key for the SPA locales
and both store listings). Workflows hand it to the tool as `GEMINI_API_KEY`, which is what
vhtranslator reads — the two names differ on purpose. Locally it is
`.user/google_gemini_translate_app_api_key.txt`.

An unchanged listing must yield: gate green, both store jobs **skipped**, no record commit. A
forced run (`-f force=true`) must yield all jobs green with the App Store leg ~1 minute.

## Recipes

- **Add a locale**: add to `LOCALES` in `store/project.mjs` (with per-store overrides if the ASC
  code differs; `null` = store lacks it) and to `store-i18n/locales.json` + vhtranslator config in
  each store repo. Run update-screenshots.yml; vhtranslator fills the texts.
- **Change a screenshot page/order**: edit the `shots` arrays in `store/project.mjs` (array order
  IS store order). Regenerate; the listing publish syncs the delta.
- **Change store texts**: edit `store-i18n/en-US/store.json` in the store repo only; CI
  translates, compiles, commits; the gate picks up the change on the next listing publish.
- **Update release notes for a release**: edit the monorepo CHANGELOG's `# Latest` section
  (tags: `#client`/`#connect`, `#android #ios #windows #linux`, `#store` for Play's 500-char
  note — all trailing, per line), then run `update-release-notes.yml` in each store repo. iOS
  notes ship with the next listing publish; the Play note ships with the next release's AAB.
  When an app's FIRST App Store version goes live, flip `RELEASE_NOTES.ios` to `true` in its
  project config.
- **Add a store (e.g. Microsoft)**: new `_publish_listing_<store>.yml` module in main following
  the appstore/play pattern (optional credential → warn+skip; `published` output), a `STORES`
  entry in `store-publish-state.mjs`, a compiler section in `store-metadata.mjs`. fastlane has no
  MS support — use msstore CLI/StoreBroker; note MS couples packages+listing in one submission.

## Debugging a wedged App Store push

Do **not** blind-rerun or cancel first. `deliver`'s "Waiting for screenshots to appear …
error=Server error got 500" means the *post-upload verification poll* is failing — the uploads
themselves usually landed. Query the truth via the ASC API (see `--check` above): find sets with a
missing/stuck file, fix surgically (the sync tool does this), restore order, and only record the
publish after verification passes.
