// the English source and verifies each translation structurally. Only the chrome around it —
// button and link labels — lives in the locale files.
// The document is fetched at setup rather than embedded so a user downloads their own language
// only. Empty until it lands, which is a frame or two from the same bundle; a spinner would
// flash for longer than the text takes to arrive.
// Unlike WHETHER the screen is shown (the head's IsLicenseAgreementRequired), WHICH text is shown
// must depend on the product: CONNECT's summary describes our servers and their logging, while
// CLIENT has no servers of ours to describe — it summarizes the bring-your-own-key reality
// instead. Showing CONNECT's promises to a CLIENT user would misstate who handles their traffic.

  <!-- Anchored absolutely to v-main (position-relative, the same anchor the reconnect bar
       uses): percentage heights (the VSheet default fill-height) resolve to auto on this chain
       because v-app only guarantees a MIN-height, which is exactly why the page used to grow
       with its text. With the box pinned to v-main, the flex column below can do its job: ONLY
       the disclosure text scrolls and the Accept button stays on-screen at every text length,
       font scale, and language. The overflow-hidden on each flex level is what lets the text
       block shrink below its content height and become the scroll container. -->
